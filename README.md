# Quadcopter_MPC
This repo has 2 functional MATLAB simulations of a quadcopter using an MPC controller. One simulation uses Euler angles (roll,pitch,yaw) to represent attitude while the other uses the Lie Group SO(3) representation. Both simulations have been tested and tuned (at least a decent amount) to fly an hourglass/figure-8 waypoint path. It can be seen that, since the Lie Group representation works on the manifold when controlling heading, it always spins the shortest distance to get to the desired heading and has no angle wrapping issues.
## Dependencies
This repo uses some of the functions from Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB. It is a pretty simple installation. After downloading the toolbox, open MATLAB, navigate to the directory with the toolbox download, and double-click the toolbox download inside of MATLAB. This with automatically set it up for you. Here is a link to the download: http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox#Downloading_the_Toolbox
